# ChainVertex

## Project Title
**ChainVertex** - Decentralized Data Vertex Management System

## Project Description

ChainVertex is a blockchain-based smart contract project designed to enable decentralized management of interconnected data vertices. Built with Solidity, it provides a secure, transparent, and efficient infrastructure for creating and managing complex data relationships on the blockchain. The system leverages the power of smart contracts to ensure immutability, trustlessness, and decentralized governance across a distributed network.

ChainVertex allows users to create vertices (data nodes), establish edges (connections) between them with weighted relationships, and query the resulting graph structure entirely on-chain. This eliminates the need for centralized databases and provides cryptographic proof of all operations.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to democratize decentralized data management by creating an open, accessible infrastructure where complex data relationships can be managed transparently without intermediaries. We envision ChainVertex becoming the backbone for Web3 applications that require sophisticated graph-based data structures with guaranteed immutability and decentralized control.

By combining the security of blockchain technology with efficient graph data structures, ChainVertex aspires to enable a new generation of decentralized applications that were previously impossible to build on-chain.

## Key Features

### 1. Vertex Creation & Management
- Create new data vertices with unique identifiers and customizable metadata
- Store and retrieve vertex information securely on-chain
- Track vertex ownership, creation timestamps, and lifecycle status
- Support for large-scale vertex networks with efficient indexing
- Vertex deletion with ownership verification

### 2. Edge Connection System
- Establish weighted connections between vertices representing various relationship types
- Create complex graph structures with support for multi-directional edges
- Assign custom relationship types and weights to connections
- Prevent circular dependencies with self-loop validation
- Efficient edge traversal and neighbor discovery

### 3. Graph Query & Data Retrieval
- Query individual vertex information with real-time data access
- Retrieve all adjacent vertices and connected relationships
- Access complete edge details including weight and relationship type
- Get user-specific vertex collections for personalized queries
- Retrieve comprehensive graph statistics (vertex count, edge count)

### 4. Security & Access Control
- Owner-based access control for sensitive operations
- Modular permission system for future enhancement
- Immutable transaction records with event logging
- Data validation and constraint enforcement
- Protection against common smart contract vulnerabilities

### 5. Event Logging & Transparency

## Smart Contract Functions

### Core Functions

1. **createVertex(string memory _data) → uint256**
   - Creates a new vertex in the graph
   - Returns the ID of the newly created vertex
   - Emits VertexCreated event

2. **createEdge(uint256 _fromVertex, uint256 _toVertex, uint256 _weight, string memory _edgeType)**
   - Establishes a connection between two vertices
   - Validates vertex existence and prevents self-loops
   - Emits EdgeCreated event

3. **getVertex(uint256 _vertexId) → Vertex**
   - Retrieves vertex information by ID
   - Returns vertex structure with metadata
   - View-only function (read operation)

## Contract Events

- `VertexCreated(uint256 indexed vertexId, address indexed owner, string data, uint256 timestamp)`
- `EdgeCreated(uint256 indexed fromVertex, uint256 indexed toVertex, uint256 weight, string edgeType)`
- `VertexDeleted(uint256 indexed vertexId, address indexed owner)`
- `EdgeDeleted(uint256 indexed fromVertex, uint256 indexed toVertex)`
